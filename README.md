# TypescriptPracticeProject
A quick practice to practice typescript, which I will be using for a bigger project.

All this project does is generates a random user and random company (random information from faker module) and uses google maps api to mark them on the map. 

Learned basic syntax/interfaces/classes of TypeScript.
